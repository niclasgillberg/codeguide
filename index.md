# Welcome to my code guide!

This is my preferred way of structuring my projects and the code within. I try to follow them on my personal projects and they form my baseline when establishing a code guide for the teams that I work in.

Even though I have my own preferred style of writing code, it is essential that every team has a similair guide for them.

>"Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that writing code for yourself is a Bad Ideaâ„¢. If thousands of people are using your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal preference of how to get clever within the spec." - Idan Gazit
